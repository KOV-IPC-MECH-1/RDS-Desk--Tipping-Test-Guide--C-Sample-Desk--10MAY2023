>**Note**
>Take care to ensure that `C-clamp` is centered on the `lock face` and tightened securely enough to elimate any play once installed.
  
## Step 3
#### Install `Luggage scale` onto `C-clamp` as shown.

>**Note**
>Be sure to attach the `Luggage scale` strap within the jaw portion of the `C-clamp`, closest to the `Drawer` outer face.
  
## Step 4
#### Zero out luggage scale before testing.

 # Testing
 
 #### 1.  Pull/push downward on `Luggage scale` handle gradually increasing force until `Desk` begins to tip and rear legs lift.
 >**Note**
 >Recommend kneeling down directly in front of the `Desk` and applying force with only 1 hand on the handle (palm downward).  Take care to pull/push directly downward parallel to the `Drawer` face as pulling in an off-angle will affect the readings.
 
 #### 2.  Release tension on the `Luggage scale` immediately to avoid `Desk` actually tipping.
 #### 3.  The black needle on the `Luggage scale` will indicate the MAX weight recorded during the test.
 #### 4.  Repeat as needed.
 >**Note**
 >Be sure to re-zero the `Luggage scale` [SEE [Step 4](#step-4) in [Setup](#setup)] and make sure Drawer is fully open and contents haven't shifted before each test.
